# slidedoom
A responsive slide library for webpages
Dont forget to add Slidedoom.css. It is needed inorder to display the slides correctly. 
Visit https://irfanit93.github.io for the implementation
 Read the Source Code initialize.html for the Documentation.
 Will be improving the Documentation as soon as I have some free time.
 Any Suggestions or Feature Request are welcome.
